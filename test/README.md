# Testing iSDX Behavior with Torch

This directory includes the **T**raffic **Orch**istrator (torch) tools for the construction, launching and automated regression testing of an iSDX system configuration.
It is designed to work with both software defined environments based on mininet and on true hardware switch configurations.

* Torch constructs and launches an iSDX configuration using a simplified network specification. The example below is equivalent to the test-ms configuration in the top-level examples directory. See the section on **Additional Examples** below for more sophisticated network configurations and policy variations.
* Torch can run an automated set of tests to validate the policies established for the iSDX. These are used to send traffic to specific destinations, verify that the traffic has indeed been delivered, and search for traffic on other nodes if it is not found where expected.  Torch can be also used to announce and withdraw routes to change the BGP view of the world.
* Torch can be run in an interactive mode for experimenting with dynamic routing changes and (TBD) policy updates.

Torch consists of a constellation of traffic receivers and generators (tnodes) managed by a controlling process (tmgr), which uses a specification file to define the hosts, network and testing actions to be performed.
A tnode is automatically started in each quagga host as part of mininet initialization.
The tests are typically designed to generate traffic that will be influenced by the policies established in the switching fabric and the advertised BGP routes.
For example, the tests in test0-mt (multi-table) verify that traffic on specific tcp ports are directed to different destinations based on a combination of outbound (A1) and inbound (C1 and C2) flow rules.
The tests in tes1-ms (multi-switch) include the test-mt tests, but also include cases that withdraw a route from B1, and later restore it, causing dynamic changes in traffic flow.

## Example Configuration 
![Experimental Setup](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LK9VEROcRoXWtfJXkBJ5guFLMEzu-PqZxLG4hCILtDI/pub?w=960&h=720)

This test setup consists of 3 Participating Autonomous Systems, A, B and C, with routers A1, B1, C1 and C2 implemented using mininet.
Routers B1, C1 and C2 have all advertised routes to 140.0.0.0/24 and 150.0.0.0/24.
Router A1 has announced routes to 100.0.0.0/24 and 110.0.0.0/24.
Specific outbound and inbound policies established by A and C will alter the default routes used for traffic.
Participant A has outbound policies that steer port 80 traffic to B and port 4321 and 4322 traffic towards C.
Participant C has inbound policies that steer port 4321 traffic towards router C1 and port 4322 traffic towards router C2.

### Testing Route Withdrawal with In-place iSDX Policies

In this example we verify that traffic will be routed according to established policies, and that when a route is withdrawn, traffic will not be sent to an autonomous system even if it has an explicit policy to do so. For the latter case, we will withdraw the route to 140.0.0.0/24 for edge router B1. This should redirect A's traffic on port 80 to C1 instead of using the outbound rule to send it to B. The steps are:

1. Tmgr instructs h1_a1 to send traffic to port 80 on the 140 network. The expectation is that this will be routed to B based on A's outbound rule.
2. The tnode at h1_a1 binds a socket to the 100 network and connects to and sends data to the 140 network.
3. Tmgr queries the tnode on the expected destination behind B (h1_b1) for evidence of the transfer.
4. Tmgr instructs B1 to withdraw its route for the 140 network.
5. Tmgr again instructs h1_a1 to send traffic to port 80 on the 140 network. Even though A still has an outbound rule for port 80, the traffic will be routed via C1 to h1_c1.
6. As before, the tnode at h1_a1 binds a socket to the 100 network and connects to and sends data to the 140 network.
7. As the test definition still defines h1_b1 as the recipient, tmgr will query for the traffic there. Failing to find it there, tmgr will interrogate all hosts to locate the transfer, in this case, on h1_c1

The network specification is shown below. Only the **test name { commands }** sequences define tests that will be run by tmgr. The remaining information defines the configuration of the network.

``` 
When creating a software (mininet) configuration, each edge router (e.g., c2) and interior host (e.g., h1_c2) will include a tnode process to receive and act upon commands.
The tnodes contain no knowledge of the tests to be performed; they are dynamically driven by the tmgr controller and are subsequently interrogated by tmgr to see if expected traffic has arrived.
This includes establishing initial listeners on specified tcp and udp ports to receive traffic.
The tnodes and tmgr communicate over a separate management network to avoid the need to establish SDX paths for their traffic.  This is based on unix domain sockets for the mininet case, and an additional set of interfaces for HW implementations.

To run an end-to-end test, create a test.spec file as above and then use the *gen_test.py* script from the test directory to build the detailed iSDX configuration files. All configuration files will be places in *output/testname* where *testname* is the name of the specification file with the *.spec* suffix removed.
Move this directory to the top-level *examples* directory. The *buildall.sh* script will construct and move all the examples below.

To execute the tests from the example above, run:

```
cd ~/iSDX/test
sh buildall.sh
sudo bash startup.sh test1-ms
```
This will run the iSDX software on the configuration *test1-ms* in the *examples* directory.
Log output will be placed in the *regress* directory.

Abridged output from this test will include:

To pause a test so additional tmgr commands can be issued, use the *-i* option.
This will run any supplied tests and then accept tmgr commands directly from the startup.sh window.


# Creating Configurations and Tests


## Specification File Format
By convention, participants or autonomous systems (AS) are numbered from **1**.
In a flow rule, the corresponding AS is lettered starting from **a**.
Edge routers, which map to quagga hosts, are identified as the AS letter concatenated with the edge router ID, starting from 1 (although internally and for autogenerated MAC address (see below) the index runs from 0).
If more than 26 AS'es are needed, doubling of letters is used, i.e., participant 27 is **aa**, participant 28 is **ab**.

A specification file contains the following constructs in the order shown.
- __mode__ 
defines the switch configuration to be used.
Values are either 'multi-switch' or 'multi-table'
- __participants__
declares the number of participating autonomous systems in the configuration.
- __peers__
declares the peering relationships between participating autonomous systems.
Multiple peerings can be defined.
- __participant__
defines the configuration for each AS.
The additional arguments are:
  * participant number - starts with 1
  * autonomous system number
  * switch port number - starts at 3 for mode multi-table and at 5 for mode multi-switch.  The special argument 'PORT' will automatically use the next available port number regardless of mode.
  * mac address for this edge router.
  The special argument 'MAC' will generate a unique MAC address with a known pattern to simplify debugging.
  Currently the format is 08:00:bb:bb:PP:RR where PP is the participant number and RR is the router index.
  * IP address for this interface
  * Additional triplets of port, mac and IP for the other edge routers in this AS
- __host__ defines the format for labeling hosts (not routers).
Host names are constructed automatically and implied in the *verify* tests described below.
A host name is constructed by concatenating one or more of the following sequences:
  * *characters*  -    a sequence of characters that will be used in the host name as is
  * NETNUMB - the index of the AS networks reachable from this AS starting with 1 
  * IP - the first 8 bits of the network address reachable from this AS
  * ROUTER - the index of the border router for this AS
  * AS - the letter(s) coresponding to the participant number
  
  Two example formats are shown below.
  The firsrt format is convenient when there are large numbers of participants or participant border routers as the route prefix is incorporated into the host name.
  The second format is the convention used in the *test-ms* and *test-mt* examples.
  ```
  host AS ROUTER _ IP                    # host names of form a1_100 a1_110
  host h NETNUMB _ AS ROUTER             # host names of the form h1_a1 h2_a1
  ```
- __announce__ declares the networks that this AS can reach.
The additional arguments are:
  * participant number for these announcements
  * one or more CIDR format network descriptions of the form a.b.c.d/prefix-bits. An interface on the corresponding quagga host will be created with the default address a.b.c.1.
  **NOTE:** If an announced network begins with a minus sign, a host will be created to represent that network, but a route to that network will not be announced to the world.
- __flow__ defines an inbound or outbound flow rule.
  * outbound rule: `flow source-AS-edge-router tcp_port >> destination_AS`
  * inbound rule: `flow AS-edge-router << tcp_port`
- __listener__ defines the listeners that will be created on each quagga host to receive data routed through the switching fabric.
The additional arguments are:
  * host for this listener
  * binding address to use on that host
  * one or more tcp ports on which to listen
- __test name { commands }__ defines a labeled group of torch commands that can be invoked as a whole. See the next section for a description of the command set.

## Torch Commands
```
    listener anyhost bind port      # start a listener on the host to receive data
    test test_name ...              # run a multi-command test
    verify src_host dst_host port   # verify a data transfer - see below for details
    announce bgprouter network ...  # advertise a BGP route
    withdraw bgprouter network ...  # withdraw a BGP route
    bgp bgprouter                   # show advertised bgp routes
    delay seconds                   # pause for things to settle
    exec anynode cmd arg arg        # execute cmd on node
    local cmd arg arg               # execute cmd on local machine
    pending anyhost                 # check if any pending or unclaimed data transfers are on host
    send host bind daddr port       # send data xmit request to source node
    comment commentary ...          # log a comment
    reset anynode                   # reset (close) listeners - takes a few seconds to take effect
    kill anynode                    # terminate a node, non recoverable
    dump anynode                    # dump any messages from a node - mainly to see if nodes are on-line
    config                          # print result of spec file parsing
    help                            # print this message
    quit                            # exit this manager; leaves nodes intact
    
    Where:
    host = a single specified host or bgprouter
    bgprouter = only a single bgp router node
    anynode = host | "hosts" | bgprouter | "bgprouters"
    anyhost = host | "hosts"
```        
##### verify command
  The traffic manager will coordinate with the traffic node on the source host to bind a socket to the appropriate interface and send data to the address implied by the destination host.
  Since in general there will be multiple edge routers that advertise the same network, it is up to the switching fabric to determine the ultimate destination based on flow rules and possibly default routing (if no flow rules match).
  
  The use of the destination host name in the verify command is only a convenience to specify that address.
  Tmgr will look up that host and get the corresponding network address as described by the *announce* configuration line in the spec file.
  However, the destination edge router name will be used by the traffic manager to confirm that the data transfer did indeed terminate on that edge router, and therefore that the switching fabric properly routed the traffic.
  If it is not found there, the traffic manager will search all hosts for the transfer results.

## Additional Examples
The specification files can be found in the *test/specs* directory.
To generate the configuration files, run the buildall.sh script from the test directory.
This will create all necessary data files and move them to the top-level *examples* directory.
(Currently, these configuration files must be placed in that directory for the iSDX software to find them, but the tests can be run from the *test* directory.)

In the following diagrams, the black dashed lines indicate an Autonomous System (AS).
The colored dash-dot-dash lines indicate a peering relationship among AS'es (except for test6-ms, which uses colors to distinguish the multiple outbound rules).

### Configurations test0-ms and test0-mt
These configurations are equivalent to the test-ms and test-mt examples in the top level examples directory and are defined here as placeholders for the data transfer tests.

### Configurations test1-ms and test1-mt
These configurations are equivalent to test-ms and test-mt in the examples directory with the exception that the host names used follow the torch naming convention of **AS_NAME | ROUTER_NUMBER | UNDERSCORE _ NETWORK_PREFIX**.
For example c1_140 is the name of the host attached to the 140 network interface on the c1 edge router.
These examples also withdraw and announce the B1 route for 140.0.0.0/24.
 
AS A directs its port 80 traffic to AS B, and its port 4321 and 4322 traffic to AS C.
AS C has inbound rules that further refine flows to routers C1 for port 4321 and C2 for port 4322.
```

flow a1 4321 >> c
flow a1 4322 >> c

### Configuration test2-ms 
This configuration is patterned on test1-ms, but adds 2 AS'es. It is intended to replicate a hardware test-bed configuration. A, C and D are patterned after A, B and C in test 1. An additional source, B, has its port 80 traffic sent to E. B also sends port 4321 and 4322 traffic to D.
